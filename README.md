# llm-d-modelservice

**ModelService** is a Helm chart that simplifies LLM deployment on llm-d by declaratively managing Kubernetes resources for serving base models. It enables reproducible, scalable, and tunable model deployments through modular presets, and clean integration with `llm-d` ecosystem components (including vLLM, Gateway API Inference Extension, LeaderWorkerSet). It provides an opinionated but flexible path for deploying, benchmarking, and tuning LLM inference workloads.

The ModelService Helm Chart proposal is accepted on June 10, 2025. Read more about the roadmap, motivation, and other alternatives considered [here](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d/blob/dev/docs/proposals/modelservice.md).

TL;DR:

Active scearios supported
- P/D disaggregation using deployments
- P/D disaggregation using LeaderWorkerSets
- One pod per DP rank (in progress)

Near future roadmap
- Migrate `llm-d-deployer` and quickstart to use this helm chart

## Getting started

Add this repository to Helm.

```
helm repo add llm-d-modelservice https://llm-d-incubation.github.io/llm-d-modelservice/
helm repo update
```

ModelService operates under the assumption that `llm-d-deployer` has been installed in a Kubernetes cluster, which installs the required prerequisites and CRDs. Read the [`llm-d-deployer` Quickstart](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-deployer/blob/main/quickstart/README.md) for more information. This helm chart requires external CRDs to be installed for usage.

At a minimal, the following should be installed:
1. Kubernetes Gateway API CRDs

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.3.0/standard-install.yaml
    ```

2. Kubernetes Gateway API Inference Extension CRDs

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/download/v0.4.0/manifests.yaml

    ```


See [examples](/examples) for how to use this Helm chart.
